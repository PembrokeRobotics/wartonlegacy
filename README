In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

This repository contains code written by my late uncle, Robert Warton. He devoted the latter part of his life to the study of prime numbers and the problem of factorisation of the products of large primes. This is the result of his many years of effort.

Unfortunately, he left behind very little documentation, and the code is poorly commented (if at all). Hopefully, with time, we can document what he has made and make it a useful resource for researchers and students.
